Probably most of you know already, but one of the team members left the community due to an internal disagreement.\nFrom his departure I took over his role, reconfigured our services to use easily redeployable docker containers, tested for different configurations and load and migrated everything to a different cloud provider with a plan that I believe is more suitable to our needs."   ,
